We all know the ELF app isn't the best
--------------------------------------

Here is an other approach... 

What you can do:
- you can mark your favourite gigs
- get notifications when an act starts
- get notifications for upcoming events
- filter by stages
- use it offline
- can be migrated to other festivals

Small network footprint  
(pull one JSON file)
